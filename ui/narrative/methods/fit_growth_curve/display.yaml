parameters :
    growth_matrix_id :
        ui-name : |
            Growth Matrix Id
        short-hint : |
            The growth matrix to examine
        long-hint  : |
            The growth matrix for which you want to fit growth curves.

    parameters_obj_name :
        ui-name : |
            Name of output data object
        short-hint : |
            Name of the output CrowthParameters object
        long-hint  : |
            Enter name for the output GrowthParameters object. Spaces are not allowed.

    fit_method :
        ui-name : |
            Which method to use for fitting of growth curves?
        short-hint : |
            Available methods are model, spline or both
        long-hint  : |
            Model method use growth models (gompertz, logistic,), spline method uses non-model spline fitting. By default, both methods are used in order model>spline, and output returns the first successfule result.

description : |
	<p>This method estimates four growth parameters for all samples in a growth matrix: maximum slope of growth curve, length of lag phase, maximal cell growth and integral (area under the growth curve).</p>
